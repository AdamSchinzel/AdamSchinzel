### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Adam Schinzel

Welcome to my Github! I am 18 years old software engineer and student from Brno, Czech republic. Here you can see some personal projects I've built in the past. 

I mostly work on web and mobile development, but I'm currently exploring web3 and learning blockchain development that I would combine with my full-stack development to create dApps from scratch.

I believe in the power of blockchain to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.
